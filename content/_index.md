<h4 class="alert alert-info">Aikido</h4>
<p>is many things to many people. The teacher of this dojo believes it to be a non-competitive fighting art that allows it's adherents to not only stay compassionate in a conflict but that this is a deceicive factor in achieving a positive outcome.</p>

<h4 class="alert alert-info">This Dojo</h4>
<p>is open to all who enjoy training Aikido, even if they don't know it yet.</p>
<p>Enjoying the training is essential, because even though Aikido training has many treassures to offer
- the ability to take deep contact, a stable center (the foundation of power), usefull reflexes, hightened awareness,
increased calmness under pressure, improved posture and nice social contacts (maybe you'll even find your tribe) -
the truth is that it takes a while to train up those. And if you're not enjoying yourself while training, you won't be around long enough.</p>
<p>While some Aikido dojos endorse the idea of competion, most - including this dojo - do not. Training instead is done in a cooperative - but challenging -
manner which is aimed at experiencing - and learning to embody - the principles underlying the art.</p>
