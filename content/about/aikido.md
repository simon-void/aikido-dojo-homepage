  <h4 class="border-3">Aikido</h4>

<p>is a relatively new martial art developed in Japan by Morihei Ueshiba over the course of his life. It's three kanji/letters can be translated as
"the way of the harmonizing force". While basically all traditional martial arts have of moral dimension - including the imperative to not do harm (if possible) -
this is at the front and center of Aikido. It is therefore more defensive in nature than other martial arts. It was mostly disseminated after the second World War
by the first generation of students of the founder. Basically every of those early teachers gave his Aikido a personal spin while even the founder kept evolving his
understanding of the art. Some teachers, and the organisations they founded, made it their goal to keep the original form alive, while other teachers where inspired to develop it according to their martial, artistic, religious or educational ideals. This development keeps going to the present day.</p>

  <h4 class="border-3">Morihei Ueshiba, aka O'Sensei</h4>

<p>was the founder of Aikido. He lived from 1883 until 1969. Trained and highly proficient in the classical martial art of Daito Ryu (Aiki) Jujutsu,
he became follower of a sect that advocated world peace. Subsequently he continued to develop his martial skills in a more and more defensive, or at least non-deadly, direction. To the end of his life it can be said that his practice became a purely spiritual embodyment of his peace-seeking religion.</p>
