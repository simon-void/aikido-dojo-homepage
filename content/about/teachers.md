  <h4 class="border-3">Stephan Schroeder: 3rd Dan Aikikai </h4>

started with Aikido in 2003 while still at university and never stopped.

After finishing the university, he moved to Berlin where he continued his training in a dojo that was affiliated with Watanabe Nobuyuki, 8 Dan, (†2018)
who's seminars Stephan visited for many years. The thing with Watanabe Sensei was that you probably didn't end up concrete answers but with very interesting questions.

Around 2010 Stephan started visiting the seminars of Stefan Stenudd, by now 7 Dan, who Stephan got interested in after seeing one of his YouTube videos. Feeling more and
more intrigued, Stephan moved to Malmö, Sweden in 2012 in order to train in Stefan Stenudd's home dojo where he - next to his Aikido training - also started with Iaido which was taught be Stefan Stenudd as well. Even though Stephan started had already received his first Dan before moving to Malmö he was, once having arrived, diagnosed with having <i>"no center whatsoever, none!!!"</i>.
Luckily and to the relief of his new teacher, Stephan was able to overcome this predicament and to show even traces of talent at times.

Having moved to Sweden in order to learn the Aikido he was intrigued by, Stephan came after 6.5 years to the conclusion that he had gotten what he'd bargained for. Knowing that the noblest goal of a student should not be to become a good student but a good teacher, he looks forward to helping others on the way that he himself started so many years ago and which still brings joy and inspiration to his life.
