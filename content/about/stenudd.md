  <h4 class="">Stefan Stenudd: 7th Dan Aikikai, 4th Dan Iaido </h4>

Stefan Stenudd is an artist in many ways, a natuaral leader and gets easily bored. Yet after more that 40 years of Aikido he has yet to become bored by his own Aikido.
It's easy to assume that one got an idea of what Stefan's Aikido looks like, but prolonged exposure will reveal its wide range and depth. This might partly be explained
by a concious effort to avoid one of the trappings of being a teacher: to only teach that which you consider yourself to be "good" in. In the spirit of Kill your Darlings
he arrived at "When you have eliminated whatever possible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth of your Aikido".

After leaving his first teacher over creative differences, Stefan found inspiration by training for and with several of the first generation of O'Sensei's studends
like Nisho Shoji, Tamura Nobuyoshi and Sugano Seiichi, who gave seminars at Stefan's dojo. Interestingly Stefan never became a formal student of any of these well known teachers. He instead evolved his Aikido while firmly being rooted in the role of a teacher. Inspiration over form, but please with substance.
